# Plinth



Due to the limited functionality of the demo project, additional API and UI scaffolding was put in place to provide a bit of a better contect for how work would be done.

What this does not include that I would have liked to get in is:

1. UI using Redux
2. UI usin React-Router
- [x] Swagger Documentation engine
4. Full unit tests
- [x] Newman Tests
6. Docker config
7. CI process
8. MySQL Database project
9. Redis Session storage
10. Neo4J and/or MongoDB connection

### Local Run
`npm install` or `yarn install`

Then, after that is complete:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

Then navigate a web browser to `http://localhost:24601/`.

The incomplete set of unit tests can be run with `npm test`.
